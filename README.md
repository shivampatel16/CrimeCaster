# CrimeCaster: Investigating Pittsburgh's High-Crime Era with 2D Trees

This project was the second among the 5 unique projects of the '95-771 - Data Structure and Algorithms for Information Processing' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prof. Mike McCarthy, a renowned genius mind in this field, taught the course. 

- Implemented a 2D Tree data structure to store crime records from Pittsburgh area.

- Developed algorithms for finding the nearest neighbors for a given crime and for finding the crimes within a specified rectangular range

- Wrote methods for converting the crime list to a string and a KML representation for visualization in Google Earth

- Implemented various other methods on the generated 2D Tree, including preOrderPrint(),  inOrderPrint(), postOrderPrint(),  levelOrderPrint(), and reverseLevelOrderPrint().
